### Session Title

What Makes TypeScript So Special?

### Session Abstract

When the Angular team chose TypeScript, they chose one of the least likely contenders. More than
200 languages compile to JavaScript, many of them more mature than TypeScript. Of the handful of
languages that support ECMAScript 6, TypeScript's support is one of the least complete. In fact,
it was chosen over Google's own transpiler Traceur, which has far better support for ES6.

Despite its apparent shortcomings, Angular is not the only team to have chosen it. Many companies
(besides Microsoft) have already adopted the language, which is also one of the fastest growing
languages on GitHub. In this talk, we'll explore some of TypeScript's more interesting features,
try to figure out what makes it so revolutionary and why you should start using it right away on
all your projects.
