### Session Title

Angular on ASP.NET 5 and Visual Studio 2015

### Session Abstract

ASP.NET 5 is a major leap forward. It unifies Web API and MVC and features a completely
rewritten and modern manifest-based project system that also supports NuGet, npm and bower, as
well as grunt and gulp. It can run on IIS, in the cloud, from the command line and on multiple
OSes. It can also be developed with any editor or IDE. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

This talk shows how to build an Angular app with an ASP.NET 5 backend using Visual Studio 2015
on Windows and Sublime or WebStorm on OmniSharp.NET on Mac.
